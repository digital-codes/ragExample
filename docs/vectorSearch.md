# Text embeddings

Texts are converted into multidimensional vector. conversion tries to consider semantic relation of words. 
Result vectors are compared, typically using cosine similarity.

# similarity search on text embeddings. useful to normalize vectors?

Yes, normalizing vectors is often useful when performing similarity search on text embeddings, and here's why:
Why Normalize Text Embedding Vectors?

Normalization involves scaling vectors to unit length (also called L2 normalization). This is beneficial for the following reasons:

    Cosine Similarity Focus:
        Many similarity measures, such as cosine similarity, are scale-invariant and rely on the angle between vectors, not their magnitude.
        Normalizing vectors ensures that cosine similarity is computed purely based on direction, which is generally what you want in text similarity tasks.

    Improved Comparability:
        Without normalization, the magnitude of embeddings could bias the similarity computation. For instance, embeddings with higher norms might disproportionately influence similarity scores.

    Efficient Search in Vector Databases:
        Vector databases like FAISS or Milvus often rely on normalized embeddings for efficient similarity search.
        Pre-normalized embeddings enable indexing algorithms to directly apply distance metrics optimized for unit vectors, such as dot product, to compute cosine similarity.

    Stable Performance Across Models:
        Text embedding models sometimes output embeddings with variable magnitudes due to input differences. Normalization mitigates this inconsistency and stabilizes similarity results.

How to Normalize Text Embeddings

Normalization involves dividing each vector by its L2 norm:
normalized_vector=vector∥vector∥2
normalized_vector=∥vector∥2​vector​

Where ∥vector∥2=∑ivectori2∥vector∥2​=∑i​vectori2​

​.
When Not to Normalize

    If Using Other Distance Metrics:
        Metrics like Euclidean distance depend on vector magnitudes. If your use case relies on magnitude-based measures, normalization might not be suitable.

    Pre-normalized Models:
        Some embedding models (like Sentence-BERT or OpenAI embeddings) might already output normalized vectors. Double-check to avoid unnecessary normalization.

    Task-Specific Needs:
        In some tasks, vector magnitude encodes additional information (e.g., confidence scores). In such cases, normalization might remove valuable information.

In summary, normalizing vectors is generally beneficial for similarity search, especially if cosine similarity or dot product is used as the metric. However, consider the specific requirements of your task and the characteristics of your embeddings before normalizing.

normalization with eigen library good?

Yes, using the Eigen library for normalization of vectors is a good choice. Eigen is a highly efficient C++ template library for linear algebra, which makes it suitable for operations like vector normalization. Here’s how and why Eigen is effective for this purpose:
Benefits of Using Eigen for Normalization

    Efficiency:
        Eigen is optimized for high performance and can efficiently handle vector operations, including L2 normalization.
        It uses advanced optimizations like expression templates to avoid unnecessary computations.

    Ease of Use:
        Eigen provides intuitive APIs for basic and advanced operations, making it simple to normalize vectors in just a few lines of code.

    High Precision:
        Eigen ensures numerical stability and accuracy, which is critical when computing norms for large or small vectors.

    Scalability:
        Eigen supports both fixed-size and dynamic-size vectors, making it adaptable for embeddings of various dimensions.

How to Normalize Vectors with Eigen

Here’s an example of how you can normalize a vector in Eigen:

#include <Eigen/Dense>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Define a vector (example: 3-dimensional vector)
    Eigen::Vector3d vec(3.0, 4.0, 0.0);

    // Calculate the L2 norm (magnitude of the vector)
    double norm = vec.norm();

    // Normalize the vector
    if (norm != 0) {
        vec /= norm;  // Element-wise division by norm
    }

    // Output the normalized vector
    std::cout << "Normalized Vector: " << vec.transpose() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

Explanation of the Code

    Eigen::Vector3d: Creates a 3-dimensional vector.
    vec.norm(): Computes the L2 norm (Euclidean norm) of the vector.
    vec /= norm: Divides each element of the vector by the norm to normalize it.

For Dynamic-Sized Vectors

If you’re working with text embeddings, the dimensions might not always be fixed. Eigen supports dynamic-sized vectors as well:

#include <Eigen/Dense>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Define a dynamic-size vector
    Eigen::VectorXd vec(5);
    vec << 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0;

    // Normalize the vector
    double norm = vec.norm();
    if (norm != 0) {
        vec /= norm;
    }

    // Output the normalized vector
    std::cout << "Normalized Vector: " << vec.transpose() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

Performance Tips

    Pre-allocate Memory for Dynamic Vectors:
        If you know the dimensions of your embeddings, pre-allocate memory to improve performance.
    Batch Normalization:
        If you need to normalize a large batch of vectors, Eigen's matrix operations can normalize multiple vectors efficiently.
    Check for Zero Norm:
        Always check if the norm is zero to avoid division by zero.

Conclusion

Eigen is a powerful and efficient library for vector normalization and is well-suited for applications like text embeddings. Its performance, simplicity, and precision make it a great choice for such tasks.

The available documentation does not specify whether the output embeddings are normalized. In many text embedding models, outputs are not normalized by default, requiring users to perform normalization when needed.

Recommendation:

To ensure consistency and optimal performance in similarity searches, it's advisable to normalize the embeddings yourself. This can be achieved by dividing each embedding vector by its L2 norm, ensuring all vectors have a unit length.

Normalization in Python with NumPy:

If you're using Python, you can normalize an embedding vector vec as follows:

import numpy as np

# Example embedding vector
vec = np.array([0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2])

# Compute the L2 norm
norm = np.linalg.norm(vec)

# Normalize the vector
if norm != 0:
    normalized_vec = vec / norm
else:
    normalized_vec = vec  # Handle the zero vector case

print(normalized_vec)

This code computes the L2 norm of the vector and divides each component by this norm, resulting in a unit vector.

Normalization in C++ with Eigen:

If you're using C++ with the Eigen library, normalization can be done as follows:

#include <Eigen/Dense>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Example embedding vector
    Eigen::VectorXd vec(4);
    vec << 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2;

    // Compute the L2 norm
    double norm = vec.norm();

    // Normalize the vector
    Eigen::VectorXd normalized_vec;
    if (norm != 0) {
        normalized_vec = vec / norm;
    } else {
        normalized_vec = vec; // Handle the zero vector case
    }

    std::cout << "Normalized Vector: " << normalized_vec.transpose() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

This C++ code uses the Eigen library to compute the L2 norm and normalize the vector accordingly.

By normalizing the embeddings, you ensure that similarity measures like cosine similarity are computed accurately, leading to better performance in tasks such as similarity search or clustering.
